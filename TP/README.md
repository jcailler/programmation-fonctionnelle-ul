# Exercises (TP)

For each TP below, we provide the signature of the functions you need to write. The body is replaced with `???`: that's the part you need to come up with!  _We strongly recommend that you think about these exercises on paper first_.

Exercises marked with ‚≠êÔ∏è are the most important ones.
Exercises marked with üî• are the most challenging ones.

The TP contain a lot of questions. You do not need to complete all exercises to succeed in this class, and you do not need to do all exercises in the order they are written.
